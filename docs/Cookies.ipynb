    "# Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "A cookie is a small piece of text data set by Web server that resided on the client's machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's been set, the client automatically returns the cookie to the web server with each request that it makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the server to place value it wishes to 'remember' in the cookie, and have access to them when creating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Django Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpRequest.COOKIES - A dictionary containing all cookies. Keys and values are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "* set_cookie() - set_cookie() is used to set/create/sent cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "        HttpResponse.set_cookies(key, value=\"\", max_age=None, expires=None, path='/', domain=None, secure=False, samesite=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "    \n",
    "        set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek')\n",
    "        \n",
    "> key - This is the name of the cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "> value - This sets the value of cookie. This value is stored on the clients computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> name and value are requried to set cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When you omit the optional cookie fields, the browser fills them in automatically with reasonable defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "> max_age - It should be a number of seconds, or None (default) if the cookie should last only as long as the client's browser session. If expires is not specified, it will be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "        set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek', max_age=60*60*24*10) // days\n",
    "        \n",
    "> expries - It describes the time when cookie will be expire. It should either be a string in the format \"Wdy,DD-Mon-YY HH:MM:SS GMT\" or a datetime.datetime object in UTC. If expires is a datetime object, the max_age will be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "    set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek', expires=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=2))\n",
    "    \n",
    "> path - Path can be / (root) or /mydir (directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "    set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek', '/')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek', path='/home')\n",
    "    \n",
    "> domain - Use domain if you want to set a cross-domain cookie. For example, domain=\"example.com\" will set a cookie that is readable by the domains www.example.com, blog.example.com, etc. Otherwise, a cookie will only be readable by the domain that set it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "    set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek', domain='google.com')\n",
    "    \n",
    "> secure - Cookie to only be transmitted over secure protocal as hhtp. When set to TRUE, the cookie will only be set if a secure connection exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "> httponly - Use httponly=True if you want to prevent client-side JavaScript from having access to the cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "> HttpOnly is a flag included in a Set-Cookie HTTP response header. It's part of the RFC 6265 standard for cookies and can be a useful way to mitigate the risk of client-side script accessing the protected cookie data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "    set_cookie(......., httponly=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "> samesite - Use samesite='Strict' or samesite='Lax' to tell the browser not to send this cookie when performing a cross-origin request. SameSite isn't supported by all browsers, so it's not a replacement for Django's CSRF protection, but rather a defense in depth measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> RFC 6265 states that user agents should support cookies of at least 4096 bytes. For many browsers this is also the maximum size. Django will not raise an exception if there's an attempt to store a cookie of more than 4096 bytes, but many browsers will not set the cookie correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading / Accessing Cookie\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpRequest.COOKIES - A dictionary containing all cookies. Keys and values are strings.\n",
    "\n",

    "    //or\n",
    "    request.COOKIES.get('key',default)\n",

    "## Replace/ Append Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we assign a new value to cookie, the current cookie are not replaced. The new cookie is parsed and its name-value pair is appended to the list. The exception is when you assign a new cookie with the same name (and same domain and path, it they exist) as a cookie that already exists. In this case the old value is replaced with the new.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "    set_cookie('name', 'Abhishek')\n",

    "## Deleting Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.delete_cookie(key, path='/', domain=None) - This method is used to delete the cookie based on given key with same domain and path, if they were set, otherwise may not be deleted.\n",

    "\n",
    "HttpReponse.set_signed_cookies(key, value, salt='', max_age=None, expries=None, Path='/', domain=None, secure=False, httponly=False, samesite=None) \n",
    "\n",
    "> It is similar to set_cookie(), but cryptographic signing the cookie before setting it. Use in conjunction with HttpRequest.get_signed_cookie().\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can use the optional salt argument for added key stregth, but you will need to remember to pass it to the corresponding HttpRequest.get_signed_cookie() call.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Signed Cookie\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpRequest.get_signed_cookie(key, default=RAISE_ERROR, salt='', max_age=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "> It returns a cookie value for a signed cookie, or raises a django.core.signing.BadSignature exception if the signature is no longer valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you provide the default argument the exception will be suppressed and that default value will be returned instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The optional salt argument can be used to provide extra protection against brute force attacks on your secret key. If supplied, the max_age argument will be checked against the signed timestamp attached to the cookie value to ensure the cookie is not older than max_age seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Cookies Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each cookie can contain 4096 bytes Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cookies can be stored in Browser and server\n",
