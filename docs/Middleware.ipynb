    "\n",
    "process_view(request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs) - It is called just before Django calls the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should return either None or an HttpResponse object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns None, Django will continue processing this request, executing any other process_view() middleware and, then, the appropriate view.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns an HttpResponse object, Django won't bother calling the appropriate view; it'll apply response middleware to that HttpResponse and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    where,\n",
    "    request - It is an HttpRequest object.\n",
    "    view_func - It is the Python function that Django is about to use. (It's the actual function object, not the name of the function as a string)\n",
    "    view_args - It is a list of positional arguments that will be passed to the view.\n",
    "    view_kwargs - It is a dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed to the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither view_args nor view_kwargs include the first view argument (request).\n",
    "\n",
    "process_exception(request, exception) - Django calls process_exception() when a view raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should return either None or an HttpRespone object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns an HttpResponse object, the template response middleware will be applied and the resulting response returned to the browser. Otherwise, default exception handling kicks in.\n",
    "\n",
    "    where,\n",
    "    request - It is an HttpRequest object.\n",
    "    exception - It is an Exception object raised by the view function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note - Middleware are run in reverse order during the response phase, which includes process_exception. If an exception middleware returns a response, the process_exception methods of the middleware classes above that middleware won't be called at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "process_template_response(request, response) - This method is called just after the view has finished executing, if the response instance has a render() method, indicating that it is a TemplateResponse or equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must return a respone object that implements a render method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    charset - The charset in which the response will be encoded. If not given it will be extracted from content_type, and if that is unsuccessful, the DEFAULT_CHARSET setting will be used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    using - The NAME of a template engine to use for loading the template.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are three circumstances under which a TemplateResponse will be rendered:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the TemplateResponse instance is explicitly rendered, using the SimpleTemplateResponse.render() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the content of the response is explicitly set by assigning response.content.\n",
    "\n",
    "After passing through template response middleware, but before passing through response middleware.\n",

    "> SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS - If set to a non-zero integer value, the SecurityMiddleware sets the HTTP Strict Transport Security header on all responses that do not already have it. Default is 0\n",

    "> SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT - If a URL path matches a regular expression in this list, the request will not be redirected to HTTPS. The SecurityMiddleware strips leading slashes from URL paths, so pattern shouldn't include them, eg.  \n",

    "> SECURE_SSL_HOST - If a string (e.g. secure.example.com), all SS: redirects will be directed to this host rather than the originally-requested host (eg. www.example.com). If SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is False, this setting has no effect. Default is None.\n",
    "\n",

Technically a URL google.com/home is distinct from google.com/home/ a search-engine indexer would treat them as separate URLs - so it's best practice to normalize URLs.\n",
