    "\n",
    "* Receiver Function - This function takes a sender argument, along with wildcard keyword arguments (* *kwargs); all signal handlers must take these arguments. A receiver can be any Python function or method.\n",

    "### Manual Connect Route \n",
    "\n",
    "To receive a signal, register a receiver function using the Signal.connect() method. The receiver function is called when the signal is sent. All of the signal's receiver functions are called one at a time, in the order they were registered.\n",

    "Signal.connect(receiver_func, sender=None, weak=True, dispatch_uid=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "    where,\n",
    "    receiver_func - The callback function which will be connected to signal.\n",
    "    sender - Specifies a particular sender to receive signals from.\n",
    "    weak - Django stores signal handlers as weak references by default. Thus, if your receiver is a local function, it may be garbage collected. To prevent this, pass weak=False when you call the signal's connect() method.\n",
    "    dispatch_uid - A unique identifier for a signal receiver in cases where duplicate signals may be sent.\n",

    "## Built-in Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Django provides a set of built-in signals that let user code get notified by Django itself of certain actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    sender - The name of the module used for authentication.\n",
    "    credentials - A dictionary of keyword arguments containing the user credentials that were passed to authenticate() or your own custom authentication backend. Credentials matching a set of 'sensitive' patterns, (including password) will not be sent in the clear as part of the signal.\n",

    "m2m_changed(sender, instance, action, reverse, model, pk, using) - Sent when a ManyToManyField is changed on a model instance.

    "\n",
    "class_prepared(sender) - Sent whenever a model class has been \"prepared\" - that is, once model has been defined and registered with Django's model system. Django uses this signal internally; it's not generally used in third-party applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this signal is sent during the app registry population process, and  AppConfig.ready() runs after the app registry is fully populated, receivers cannot be connected in that method.

    "    plan - The migration plan that is going to be used for the migration run. While the plan is not public API, this allows for the rare cases when it is necessary to know the plan.
